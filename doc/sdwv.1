.SH NAME
sdcv \- console version of StarDict program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sdcv 
[ 
.BI options 
] 
[list of words]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I sdcv 
is a simple, cross-platform text-based utility
for working with dictionaries in StarDict format.
Each word from "list of words" may be a string
with a leading '/' for using a Fuzzy search algorithm,
with a leading '|' for using full-text search,
and the string may contain '?' and '*' for regexp search.
It works in interactive and non-interactive mode.
To exit from interactive mode press Ctrl+D. 
In interactive mode, 
if sdcv was compiled with readline library support,
you can use the UP and DOWN keys to cycle through history.

.SH FILES
.TP 
/usr/share/stardict/dic
.TP
$(HOME)/.stardict/dic

Place where sdcv expects to find dictionaries.
Instead of /usr/share/stardict/dic you can use any directory
you want, just set the STARDICT_DATA_DIR environment variable.
For example, if you have dictionaries in /mnt/data/stardict-dicts/dic,
set STARDICT_DATA_DIR to /mnt/data/stardict-dicts.
.TP
$(HOME)/.sdcv_history

This file includes the last $(SDCV_HISTSIZE) words, which you sought with sdcv.
SDCV uses this file only if it was compiled with readline library support.
.TP
$(HOME)/.sdcv_ordering

This is a text file containing one dictionary bookname per line.
It specifies in which order the results of a search should be shown.
.SH ENVIRONMENT 
Environment Variables Used By \fIsdcv\fR:
.TP 20
.B STARDICT_DATA_DIR
If set, sdcv uses this variable as the data directory, this means that sdcv
searches dictionaries in $\fBSTARDICT_DATA_DIR\fR\\dic
.TP 20
.B SDCV_HISTSIZE
If set, sdcv writes in $(HOME)/.sdcv_history the last $(SDCV_HISTSIZE) words, 
which you look up using sdcv. If it is not set, then the last 2000 words are saved in $(HOME)/.sdcv_history.
.TP 20
.B SDCV_PAGER
If SDCV_PAGER is set, its value is used as the name of the program
to use to display the dictionary article.
